## audit-to-ntfy: directory watch rule example
## Copy to /etc/audit/rules.d/50-dir-watch.rules and adjust the path.
## Read events (-p r) are intentionally excluded to avoid noise.
##
## -p wxa meaning:
##   w = write/create/truncate
##   x = execute
##   a = attribute changes (chmod, chown)
##
## Uncomment and adapt:
##
## -a always,exit -F dir=/path/to/watched/directory/ -F perm=wxa -k dir-watch
